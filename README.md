# The Oldest Law of Power: Technology, Human Hierarchy, and the Architecture of the Emerging Global Order

## Abstract
This monograph examines how technology has consistently shaped human hierarchy and national power. From early tools to modern AI, technological capability determines which societies rise or decline. In the twenty-first century, complexity makes engineering depth—not ideology or leadership—the central determinant of geopolitical strength. Nations with strong STEM capacity become system-builders; those with moderate capability become system-consumers; others remain system-dependent. Case studies of TikTok, Douyin, CapCut, and Jianying illustrate how modern platforms function as sovereign digital infrastructures. As global complexity increases, technological capacity remains the most decisive factor shaping the emerging world order.
